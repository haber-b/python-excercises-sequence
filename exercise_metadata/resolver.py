"""Exercise path resolver.

This module provides the canonical resolver API for the metadata-driven
layout.  It accepts ONLY exercise_key as input; non-string path objects
raise TypeError and path-like strings fail fast with a clear resolver error.

Legacy notebook-root override env var is deliberately ignored; this resolver targets the
canonical exercise home convention, ``exercises/<construct>/<exercise_key>/``.
