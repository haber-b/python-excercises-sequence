"""Minimal exercise.json schema definition.

Canonical fields (all required):
    schema_version  int   always 1 for this schema
    exercise_key    str   unique slug, e.g. "ex004_sequence_debug_syntax"
    exercise_id     int   numeric exercise number (4)
    slug            str   same as exercise_key for canonical exercises
    title           str   human-readable exercise title
    construct       str   programming construct, e.g. "sequence"
    exercise_type   str   exercise type, e.g. "debug", "modify"
    parts           int   number of exercise parts/tasks

Convention-based fields (deliberately excluded from metadata):
    tags            - derived from parts and exercise_type at runtime
    notebook paths  - convention: exercises/<construct>/<exercise_key>/notebooks/
    ordering        - derived from exercise_id
    mandatory cells - fixed by repository convention, not per-exercise config
